# Instagram
This application is basically a clone of an existing application known as Instagram. I customized the layout and gave it a funky look. It has Firebase authentication to register a user and login as well. After that you can setup your profile and bio. You can post pictures from either your gallery or your camera and share it with your friends. Other users are also able to view and report your posts. I also added an admin panel just in case a user reports a post as offensive or for any other reason, the admin has the rights to decide whether the post should be taken down or restored.
