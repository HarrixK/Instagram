# Instagram
This application was basically a clone of an existing application known as Instagram. I customized the layout and gave it a funky look. It had Firebase authentication to register a user and login as well. After that you can setup your profile and bio as well. You can post pictures from either your gallery or your camera and share it with your friends. Other users can also like your posts as well. I also added an admin panel just in case a user reports a post as offensive or for any other reason, the admin has the rights to decide whether the post should be taken down or restored.
